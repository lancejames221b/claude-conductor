# Claude Conductor Examples

## Development Workflows

### 1. **Parallel Code Quality Check**
```bash
# Run multiple code quality checks simultaneously
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh create "lint" "analyze all Python files and fix linting issues"
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh create "test" "run all unit tests and report results"
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh create "security" "run security scan using bandit or similar tools"

# Monitor progress
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh status

# Get results from each
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh results "task-lint-[timestamp]"
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh results "task-test-[timestamp]"
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh results "task-security-[timestamp]"
```

### 2. **Sequential Analysis with Continuation**
```bash
# Initial codebase analysis
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh create "analyze" "analyze the structure of this codebase and identify main components"

# Wait for completion, then continue with documentation
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh continue "task-analyze-[timestamp]" "based on the analysis, generate comprehensive documentation"

# Continue with testing strategy
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh continue "task-task-analyze-[timestamp]-continue-[timestamp]" "create a testing strategy based on the codebase structure"
```

### 3. **System Administration Workflow**
```bash
# System health check
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh create "health" "check system resources, disk space, and running processes"

# Performance analysis
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh create "performance" "analyze system performance and identify bottlenecks"

# Security audit
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh create "audit" "perform security audit of system configuration"

# Generate comprehensive report
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh continue "task-health-[timestamp]" "create a comprehensive system report combining health, performance, and security findings"
```

## Investigation Workflows

### 4. **Bug Investigation and Fix**
```bash
# Initial bug analysis
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh create "debug" "investigate the database connection timeout issue in the logs"

# Continue with deeper analysis
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh continue "task-debug-[timestamp]" "analyze the connection pool configuration and suggest fixes"

# Implement and test fix
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh continue "task-task-debug-[timestamp]-continue-[timestamp]" "implement the suggested database connection fixes and test them"
```

### 5. **Performance Investigation**
```bash
# Performance profiling
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh create "profile" "profile the application performance and identify slow endpoints"

# Memory analysis
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh create "memory" "analyze memory usage patterns and identify potential leaks"

# Continue with optimization recommendations
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh continue "task-profile-[timestamp]" "based on profiling results, provide specific optimization recommendations"
```

## Data Analysis Workflows

### 6. **Log Analysis Pipeline**
```bash
# Parse and analyze logs
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh create "logs" "analyze the application logs from the last 24 hours for errors and patterns"

# Error categorization
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh continue "task-logs-[timestamp]" "categorize the errors found and prioritize by frequency and severity"

# Generate incident report
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh continue "task-task-logs-[timestamp]-continue-[timestamp]" "create an incident report with root cause analysis and remediation steps"
```

### 7. **Search and Resume Previous Work**
```bash
# Search for previous database-related work
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh search "database" command

# Resume a specific debugging session
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh resume "task-debug-1754581200" "continue investigating the connection pool issue with the new information"

# Search for completed security tasks
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh search "completed" status | grep security
```

## Complex Orchestration Examples

### 8. **Full CI/CD Pipeline Simulation**
```bash
# Code quality phase
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh create "lint" "run linting and code style checks"
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh create "test" "run all unit tests"
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh create "coverage" "generate test coverage report"

# Wait for quality checks, then continue with build
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh continue "task-test-[timestamp]" "if tests pass, build the application for staging"

# Security and deployment preparation
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh create "security-scan" "run SAST and dependency vulnerability scans"
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh continue "task-security-scan-[timestamp]" "if security scan passes, prepare deployment artifacts"
```

### 9. **Research and Documentation Workflow**
```bash
# Research phase
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh create "research" "research best practices for implementing microservices authentication"

# Continue with design
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh continue "task-research-[timestamp]" "based on research, design an authentication architecture for our microservices"

# Implementation planning
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh continue "task-task-research-[timestamp]-continue-[timestamp]" "create an implementation plan with specific tasks and timeline"

# Documentation generation
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh continue "task-task-task-research-[timestamp]-continue-[timestamp]-continue-[timestamp]" "generate comprehensive technical documentation for the authentication system"
```

## Utility Examples

### 10. **Session Management**
```bash
# Check all active sessions
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh status

# Export session data for analysis
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh export analysis-$(date +%Y%m%d).json

# Clean up completed sessions
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh cleanup

# Update session status
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh update
```

### 11. **Claude Desktop Integration**
In Claude Desktop with the orchestrator system prompt:

```
orchestrate: analyze this codebase, fix linting issues, run tests, and generate a deployment checklist

ðŸŽ¼ investigate the performance issues reported by users, analyze logs, and provide optimization recommendations

orchestrate: set up monitoring for our microservices, create alerting rules, and generate a monitoring dashboard specification
```

## Tips for Effective Usage

1. **Use Descriptive Task Names**: Makes searching and continuing easier
2. **Break Complex Tasks**: Use continuation for multi-step workflows
3. **Monitor Progress**: Use `status` command to track multiple sessions
4. **Preserve Context**: Continuation automatically includes previous results
5. **Clean Up Regularly**: Use `cleanup` to remove completed sessions
6. **Export Important Sessions**: Use `export` for important workflow documentation

## Session Lifecycle Example

```bash
# 1. Create initial session
session=$(./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh create "project-audit" "audit this project for security and performance issues")
echo "Created: $session"

# 2. Monitor progress
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh status

# 3. Get results when complete
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh results "$session"

# 4. Continue with follow-up work
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh continue "$session" "create remediation plan for the issues found"

# 5. Search for related work later
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh search "audit" task_name

# 6. Export the complete workflow
./enhanced-tmux-manager.sh export "project-audit-workflow.json"
```

**These examples demonstrate the power of orchestrated multi-agent workflows with full session tracking and continuation capabilities! ðŸŽ¼**
